**Unlocking EB1A Success: The Power of Conference Paper Reviews**

Did you know reviewing conference papers could be your ticket to EB1A success? Let’s demystify the process and show you how strategic paper reviews can strengthen your application.

- 🏅 **Purposeful Judging:** Reviewing conference papers is a critical activity for building evidence under the EB1A 'judging' criteria.

- 🎯 **Set Your Targets:** Aim for 2-3 conference paper reviews—minimum of 2, but more if your schedule allows. There’s no strict upper limit!

- 🤝 **Teamwork Matters:** The EB1A Experts team handles outreach and account setup, while you monitor communications, report review assignments, and coordinate with your account manager.

- 🗂️ **Smart Assignment Process:** Program chairs assign papers via portals like EDAS or Microsoft CMT. Bid on multiple papers to maximize your chances of getting assignments.

- 🔍 **Focused Reviews:** Stick to papers in your field. Provide structured feedback on innovation, technical merit, and presentation. Always request certificates or save email evidence.

- 💡 **Quality Counts:** Thorough, constructive feedback is encouraged, but certificate issuance and EB1A outcomes don’t hinge on review quality.

- ⏱️ **Master Time Management:** Each paper takes about 30 minutes. Use AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline your review process when needed.

- 📁 **Document Everything:** Store reviewed papers, grading sheets, and acceptance emails in a shared Google Drive folder for easy documentation.

- 📊 **Paper Quantity:** Review 2-3 papers per conference (up to 5 if assigned), but steer clear of reviewing more than 10 to maintain quality and manageability.

- ❓ **Get Answers:** The guide tackles FAQs about portals, timelines, review guidelines, and sample review structures.

- 📧 **Keep Communicating:** Regular follow-up with conference chairs and prompt updates in project management tools are vital for tracking progress and evidence collection.

- 🎓 **Certificate Alternatives:** If a conference doesn’t issue certificates, email exchanges and stored documents work as solid proof.
